# Planning Guide: Beyond Perfect Prompts

While crafting good prompts is important, successful AI development with Roo Code relies more heavily on proper planning and structured thinking. This guide explores how to approach software development with AI assistance effectively.

## The Planning Mindset

### Why Planning Matters
1. Complex Problem Decomposition
   - Break down large tasks
   - Identify dependencies
   - Manage scope effectively

2. Clear Goal Setting
   - Define success criteria
   - Establish milestones
   - Track progress

3. Risk Management
   - Identify potential issues
   - Plan mitigation strategies
   - Set up fallbacks

## Planning Strategies

### 1. Start with Architecture
```
User: Let's build a new feature
Roo (Architect): Before coding, let's:
1. Define requirements
2. Design system architecture
3. Plan implementation phases
4. Identify potential challenges
```

### 2. Break Down Tasks
```
User: How should we approach this project?
Roo: Let's break it into manageable pieces:
1. Core functionality
2. Supporting features
3. Integration points
4. Testing requirements
```

### 3. Set Clear Objectives
- Define measurable goals
- Establish success criteria
- Create validation steps

## Effective Planning Techniques

### 1. Requirements Gathering
```
What we need:
- Functional requirements
- Performance criteria
- Security requirements
- Scalability needs
```

### 2. System Design
```
Architecture components:
- Service boundaries
- Data flow
- Integration points
- Security measures
```

### 3. Implementation Planning
```
Development phases:
1. Core infrastructure
2. Basic functionality
3. Advanced features
4. Testing & validation
```

## Working with Roo Code

### Mode Selection Strategy

#### Architect Mode
- System design
- Technical decisions
- Architecture review
- Pattern selection

#### Code Mode
- Implementation
- Testing
- Debugging
- Optimization

#### Ask Mode
- Research
- Clarification
- Best practices
- Knowledge sharing

### Context Management

1. Memory Bank Usage
   - Document decisions
   - Track progress
   - Maintain context
   ```
   User: update memory bank
   Roo: Documenting current state and next steps...
   ```

2. Context Mentions
   - Reference relevant files
   - Include folder structures
   - Share code snippets

## Planning Patterns

### 1. Top-Down Approach
```
1. System overview
2. Component breakdown
3. Interface definitions
4. Implementation details
```

### 2. Bottom-Up Approach
```
1. Core functionality
2. Feature integration
3. System composition
4. Overall architecture
```

### 3. Iterative Planning
```
1. Initial prototype
2. Feedback gathering
3. Refinement
4. Expansion
```

## Common Planning Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Reliance on Prompts
Instead of:
```
User: Write the perfect code for X
```

Better approach:
```
User: Let's plan how to implement X:
1. What are the requirements?
2. How should we structure this?
3. What potential issues should we consider?
```

### 2. Skipping Architecture
Instead of:
```
User: Start coding feature X
```

Better approach:
```
User: Let's design feature X:
1. How does it fit into the system?
2. What are the interfaces?
3. How should we handle errors?
```

### 3. Insufficient Breaking Down
Instead of:
```
User: Implement the entire system
```

Better approach:
```
User: Let's break this down into phases:
1. Core functionality
2. Supporting features
3. Integration
4. Testing
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Documentation First
- Write requirements
- Create design docs
- Plan test cases
- Document APIs

### 2. Incremental Development
- Start small
- Build incrementally
- Test frequently
- Refactor as needed

### 3. Regular Reviews
- Architecture reviews
- Code reviews
- Performance reviews
- Security audits

## Planning Tools

### 1. Memory Bank
- Track decisions
- Document progress
- Maintain context
- Plan next steps

### 2. Custom Modes
- Role-specific planning
- Specialized expertise
- Focused workflows

### 3. Context Mentions
- Reference documentation
- Include code context
- Share requirements
